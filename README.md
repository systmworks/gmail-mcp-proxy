# Gmail MCP Server

Self-hosted [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that exposes Gmail and Google Calendar to Claude.ai (or any MCP client) via a standard OAuth 2.0 flow — no stored tokens, no pre-generated credentials.

## How it works

```
Claude.ai ──[OAuth]──► This server ──[OAuth]──► Google
Claude.ai ──[MCP]────► This server ──[Gmail API]──► Gmail / Calendar
```

The server acts as an OAuth proxy: it presents itself as an OAuth 2.0 authorization server to Claude, and internally delegates authentication to Google. After the user grants access, Google tokens are stored server-side (in memory) and injected per-request. A short-lived JWT is issued to Claude as the bearer token.

**Multiple accounts** — add the server twice in Claude with different alias URLs (`/personal/mcp`, `/work/mcp`). Each session is isolated; authenticate each with a different Google account.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+ (or Docker — a `Dockerfile` is included)
- A reverse proxy that terminates HTTPS in front of the server's port `8000`
- A Google Cloud project with:
  - **Gmail API** and **Google Calendar API** enabled
  - An OAuth 2.0 **Web application** client
  - Authorized redirect URI: `https://<your-domain>/gmail/auth/callback`

## Setup

### 1. Google Cloud

1. Go to [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com) → APIs & Services → Credentials
2. Create an **OAuth 2.0 Client ID** (type: Web application)
3. Add `https://<your-domain>/gmail/auth/callback` to **Authorized redirect URIs**
4. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret

### 2. Deploy

```bash
git clone https://github.com/systmworks/gmail-mcp-proxy
cd gmail-mcp-proxy

cp .env.example .env
# Fill in GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
# JWT_SECRET can be any long random string: openssl rand -hex 32
# BASE_URL should be https://<your-domain>/gmail
```

Run it however you prefer — the server listens on port `8000`:

```bash
# With Python directly
pip install -r requirements.txt
set -a && . ./.env && set +a   # load the variables from .env
python server.py

# Or with the included Dockerfile
docker build -t gmail-mcp .
docker run -d --env-file .env -p 8000:8000 gmail-mcp
```

Put it behind any reverse proxy that terminates HTTPS (Caddy, nginx, Traefik, …) and forwards `https://<your-domain>/gmail` to port `8000`.

#### Docker Compose example

A minimal `compose.yml` to run the container — uncomment the labels for whichever proxy you use:

```yaml
services:
  gmail-mcp:
    build: .
    # image: gmail-mcp           # or a prebuilt image instead of build
    env_file: .env
    restart: unless-stopped
    # expose the port only if your proxy reaches it directly (not via a shared network)
    # ports:
    #   - "8000:8000"

    labels:
      # ── caddy-docker-proxy ────────────────────────────────────────────────
      # caddy: your-domain.com
      # caddy.handle_path: /gmail*
      # caddy.handle_path.reverse_proxy: "{{upstreams 8000}}"

      # ── Traefik (strips the /gmail prefix before forwarding) ──────────────
      # traefik.enable: "true"
      # traefik.http.routers.gmail-mcp.rule: "Host(`your-domain.com`) && PathPrefix(`/gmail`)"
      # traefik.http.routers.gmail-mcp.tls.certresolver: "le"
      # traefik.http.routers.gmail-mcp.middlewares: "gmail-strip"
      # traefik.http.middlewares.gmail-strip.stripprefix.prefixes: "/gmail"
      # traefik.http.services.gmail-mcp.loadbalancer.server.port: "8000"
```

With **nginx** (no labels — point a `location` block at the container):

```nginx
location /gmail/ {
    proxy_pass http://gmail-mcp:8000/;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
}
```

Note: `BASE_URL` must match the public path the proxy serves (e.g. `https://your-domain.com/gmail`), since the server builds its OAuth redirect URIs from it.

#### Deploying to Railway / Render

On a PaaS platform (Railway, Render, etc.) there's no path prefix or reverse proxy to
configure — the platform gives the container its own domain and terminates HTTPS itself:

1. Create a new service from this repo (the `Dockerfile` is detected automatically).
2. Generate a public domain for the service, e.g. `your-app.up.railway.app`.
3. Set `BASE_URL` to that bare domain — `https://your-app.up.railway.app`, no path suffix.
4. Set `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `JWT_SECRET` as usual (see
   Configuration below).
5. Use `https://your-app.up.railway.app/auth/callback` as the Authorized redirect URI
   in the Google Cloud OAuth client.

The server reads the platform-injected `PORT` env var automatically, so no port
configuration is needed.

### 3. Connect to Claude.ai

In Claude.ai → Settings → Integrations → Add MCP server:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| URL | `https://<your-domain>/gmail/mcp` |
| OAuth Client ID | your Google client ID |
| OAuth Client Secret | your Google client secret |

Click **Connect** and authenticate with your Google account.

**Two accounts:** add a second connector with URL `https://<your-domain>/gmail/work/mcp` (any alias works — `/personal/mcp`, `/work/mcp`, etc.) and authenticate with the second account. Both share the same server and OAuth flow.

## Configuration

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | Google OAuth client ID |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Google OAuth client secret |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Secret for signing session JWTs (any random string) |
| `BASE_URL` | Public base URL, e.g. `https://example.com/gmail` (no trailing slash) |
| `ALLOWED_REDIRECT_URIS` | Optional. Comma-separated allowlist of OAuth redirect URIs `/authorize` will accept. Defaults to Claude.ai's callback (`https://claude.ai/api/mcp/auth_callback`) — only change this if you're connecting a non-Claude.ai MCP client. |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Optional. Python logging level (`INFO`, `WARNING`, `DEBUG`, etc.). Defaults to `INFO`. |
| `READ_ONLY_ALIASES` | Optional. Comma-separated list of connector aliases (e.g. `work`) that should be restricted to read-only access — no send, draft, label changes, or trash. See below. |

## Read-only accounts

To connect an account you want Claude to only ever read from — never send, delete, or
modify — add its alias to `READ_ONLY_ALIASES`, e.g. `READ_ONLY_ALIASES=work` for a
connector added at `/work/mcp`. That account's Google OAuth grant will only ever request
`gmail.readonly`/`calendar.readonly` — no write scope is ever issued for it, so even a
bug in this server can't make it send or delete anything; Google's API rejects it
regardless. The server also refuses write tool calls itself with a clear error, as a
second layer.

**This depends on Claude sending the standard OAuth `resource` parameter** identifying
which connector is authenticating, which MCP's authorization spec calls for but isn't
something this project controls. After connecting a read-only-configured account, verify
it actually took effect:

1. Check the server logs right after connecting — look for a line like
   `authorize: alias='work' resource='...' -> read-only`. If `alias` comes back empty
   instead, the restriction silently didn't apply for that connection, even though the
   account was still granted read access — reconnect and check again, and if it keeps
   happening, treat that alias as read/write for now.
2. Ask Claude, through that connector, to send a test email or trash a message. It
   should be refused.

## Notes

- Sessions are stored in memory — a server restart requires re-authentication in Claude.ai
- Google access tokens are refreshed automatically using the stored refresh token
- The server issues 30-day JWTs; Claude re-authenticates when they expire
